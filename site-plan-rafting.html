        <p>The Whitewater Rafting Site Project is a website project that will be built throughout the course. The goal of the project is to meet the course outcomes and objectives through development specifications that match learning activities and assignments. You will be involved in the planning, design, development, and deployment of your own whitewater rafting site. Some of the pages have more prescriptive requirements than others. There will be opportunities for you to demonstrate competency and your own creativity.</p>

        <h4>Colored Callout Example Font</h4>

        <p>White water rafting is a recreation where typically a non-motorized watercraft floats and navigates down free-flowing rivers. A rafting company organizes and manages trips which most often include experienced guides. The business intent is to provide a thrilling and safe experience to individuals and groups for a fee.</p>
