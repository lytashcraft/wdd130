    <img src="images/brasil.png" alt="Brazil" width="200">
    <p>Brazil is a country of immense diversity and contrasts. It's a vast nation with a rich blend of cultures, races, and traditions reflecting its Indigenous, African, European, and Asian roots. Music, soccer, Carnival, and food are vibrant symbols of this diversity. Brazil is also a place of resilience, where the joy of life and the hospitality of its people stand out, regardless of the difficulties.</p>
